# `lib/`

This directory contains helper scripts that define constants, global variables, and other shared functionality that you would wish to import in your main applications. These can be custom scripts or third-party dependencies that are included from external sources.

## Scripts

| Usage           | Description                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [`install-bpm`] | Script used to install the bash package manager. |

## Copyright Header

When creating helper scripts, you may want to include a copyright header at the top of the file. This can be modified to include additional information that is unique to the script.

Here is a boilerplate copyright header that can be turned into a snippet for your IDE of choice:

```bash
